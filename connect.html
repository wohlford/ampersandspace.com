          <p>Ampersand - A cooperative for creative coworking. The first coworking space in Montgomery, Alabama dedicated to providing creative freelancers and professionals an environment to thrive.</p>
          
          <p>Ampersand was designed for creatives to have a dedicated space to work, learn and meet in a professional setting - escaping isolation at home and distractions at the coffee shop. &ldquo;The goal is to foster a cooperative, member-run environment full of innovation, collaboration, creativity, and opportunity,&rdquo; said Joe Birdwell, an independent creative professional and Ampersand Founding Board member. &ldquo;Members will primarily continue to work independently on their projects and with their clients as well as having the opportunity to work in collaboration with each other and Stamp to help Stamp meet their client&rsquo;s marketing objectives.&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>Ampersand is an initiative of Stamp Idea Group, a 2013 merger of long-time Montgomery based advertising agencies LWT and Reid/O&rsquo;Donahue. &ldquo;One of Stamp&rsquo;s four long-term strategic goals is to be the most creative agency in Alabama,&rdquo; said David Allred, Managing Director and Principal with Stamp. &ldquo;We believe that our incubation of this creative cooperative will draw together a large group of independent creatives. We see the result as a win-win for all creative talent in the River Region as well as a positive step toward effectively serving our clients and helping to achieve another one of our strategic goals.&rdquo;</p>
